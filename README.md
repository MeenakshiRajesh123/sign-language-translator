# 🧠 Sign Language Translator (AI-Powered)

A deep-learning–based **real-time Sign Language Translator** built with TensorFlow and OpenCV.  
The system recognizes static ASL (A–Z, “space”, “nothing”, “del”) signs from webcam video and translates them into text in real time.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project was built step-by-step:

1. **Data Processing** – Prepared and split images into training, validation, and test folders.  
2. **Model Design & Training** – Used **MobileNetV2** with transfer learning to train on ASL dataset.  
3. **Checkpoint & Resume** – Implemented progress tracking and checkpointing for safe resuming.  
4. **Model Evaluation** – Tested model on unseen data and generated performance metrics.  
5. **Real-Time Translator** – Created a webcam-based interface for live gesture prediction.
